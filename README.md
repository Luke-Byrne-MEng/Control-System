# Control-System
Matlab / Simulink project. A noisey step response from a plant is processed, and Zeigler-Nichols, Haglund Astrom and Cohen & Coon controllers are designed to improve the response. The influence of step desturbances, and saturation are also investigated. Saturation is compensated for via anti-windup. Please see the [full report](https://github.com/Luke-Byrne-uni/Control-System/blob/main/Report.pdf) for details.
